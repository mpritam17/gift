# Propose Day Photos 💍

Place your photos in this directory. The gallery will display them automatically.

## How to add photos:

1. Add your photos to this folder with the following naming convention:
   - `photo1.jpg`
   - `photo2.jpg`
   - `photo3.jpg`
   - ... and so on

2. The component currently expects 6 photos (photo1.jpg through photo6.jpg)

3. You can modify the captions in `/frontend/src/pages/ProposeDay.jsx` in the `samplePhotos` array.

## Supported formats:
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- WebP

## Recommended dimensions:
- Portrait orientation works best (3:4 aspect ratio)
- Minimum resolution: 600x800 pixels for best quality

Happy Propose Day! 💕
